## Project Overview:

An Induction Heater is capable of heating and melting ferrous metals (Iron, Steel, etc). My Induction heater uses a ZVS Driver (Zero Voltage Switching) which is extremely efficient circuit which allow my IRLZ44N MOSFETS to switch high currents, causing minimal heating inside MOSFETS. The capacitor bank and work coil form the resonant circuit which allow for the classic heating of metals.
